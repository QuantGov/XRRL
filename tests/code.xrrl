                <p>
                    a) General. Through an agency's implementation of the
                    guidance in this part, this part applies to all entities,
                    other than those exempted in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d)
                    of this section, that—
                </p>
                <p>
                    (1) Apply for or receive agency awards; or
                </p>
                <p>
                    (2) Receive subawards directly from recipients of those
                    agency awards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (b) Exemptions for individuals. None of the requirements
                    in this part apply to an individual who applies for or
                    receives Federal financial assistance as a natural person
                    (i.e., unrelated to any business or non-profit organization
                    he or she may own or operate in his or her name).
                </p>
                <p>
                    (c) Exemptions for Federal agencies. The requirement in
                    this part to maintain a current registration in the SAM
                    does not apply to an agency of the Federal Government that
                    receives an award from another agency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (d) Other exemptions. (1) Under a condition identified in
                    paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an agency may exempt an
                    entity from an applicable requirement to obtain a unique
                    entity identifier, register in the SAM, or both.
